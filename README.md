# RegTech Neural Network for Cross-Border Data-Protection Compliance

## Overview

The **RegTech Neural Network for Cross-Border Compliance** is an AI-driven compliance management platform designed to help businesses meet and maintain data protection requirements across multiple jurisdictions. The system uses neural networks to analyze and adapt to changes in regulations, track compliance status, and automate audit preparation. Key features include:

- **Real-Time Compliance Tracking**: Monitors updates in global data protection regulations.
- **Intelligent Compliance Insights**: Provides actionable insights using a neural network model tailored for compliance.
- **Automated Audits and Reporting**: Automates compliance status checks, generates audit-ready reports, and sends alerts for non-compliance risks.
- **Centralized Compliance Dashboard**: A user-friendly dashboard for monitoring compliance across regions, managing audits, and visualizing insights.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.9 or higher
- Docker 

### Setup Instructions

1. **Clone the Repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/RegTech-Neural-Network-Compliance.git
   cd RegTech-Neural-Network-Compliance
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**
   Install the required Python packages by running:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Configuration**
   - Create a configuration file named `config/config.yaml`.
   - Include necessary API keys, database connection settings, and model parameters as shown in the example below:

     ```yaml
     database:
       host: localhost
       port: 5432
       user: admin
       password: secret_password

     api_keys:
       regulatory_api: "YOUR_REGULATORY_API_KEY"
       language_translation: "YOUR_TRANSLATION_API_KEY"

     neural_network:
       model_path: models/model_v1
       epochs: 50
       batch_size: 32

     logging:
       level: INFO
     ```

4. **Run Initial Data Setup (Optional)**
   - To load any required initial data, place the data files in the `data/raw/` directory and preprocess them if necessary by running:
     ```bash
     python scripts/data_preprocessing.py
     ```

5. **Launch the Application**
   - To start the compliance management application:
     ```bash
     python src/main.py
     ```

### Docker Setup

1. **Build Docker Image**
   ```bash
   docker build -t regtech-compliance .
   ```

2. **Run Docker Container**
   ```bash
   docker run -p 5000:5000 regtech-compliance
   ```

## Usage

1. **Run Compliance Tracking**
   - Start the application and monitor compliance by fetching the latest regulations from the configured regulatory API.
   - The neural network model will analyze changes and generate compliance recommendations.

2. **Generate Reports**
   - The system periodically generates reports on compliance status. Access these reports from the dashboard or by running:
     ```bash
     python scripts/generate_report.py
     ```

3. **Access the Dashboard**
   - Once running, the applicationâ€™s dashboard will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` (or your chosen port).
   - The dashboard provides visualizations of compliance status, recent audits, and actionable insights from the neural network model.

4. **Perform Automated Audits**
   - To initiate an automated audit, use:
     ```bash
     python scripts/automated_audit.py
     ```
   - This will generate a detailed report on compliance status, highlighting any issues that need attention.
